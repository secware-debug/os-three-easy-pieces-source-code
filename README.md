# Operating System: Three Easy Pieces â€” Example Code

This repository contains **sample source code examples** inspired by the book *[Operating System: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)* by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau.  

The purpose of this repo is to provide **hands-on code** to better understand key Operating System concepts such as:
- Processes and Threads  
- Virtual Memory and Address Translation  
- File Systems and I/O  
- Concurrency and Synchronization  
- Scheduling and Resource Management  

Each folder demonstrates small, focused programs that map to topics from the book, making it easier to bridge the gap between theory and practice.
